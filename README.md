# Oscilloscope GUI 
This Python program constructs a graphical user interface (GUI) for the real-time display of data from a PicoScope oscilloscope. Utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI components and matplotlib for data plotting, the application interfaces with the PicoScope device via the PicoSDK API. This interaction is facilitated through the ctypes library, which allows for calling functions from the PicoScope's shared library.

This project was executed in parallel with the completion of the book "Python for the Lab" by Aquiles Carattino, at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology (IPK) in Berlin, under the supervision of Martin Hepper.
