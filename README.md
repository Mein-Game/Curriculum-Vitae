# Oscilloscope GUI 
This Python program constructs a graphical user interface (GUI) for the real-time display of data from a PicoScope oscilloscope. Utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI components and matplotlib for data plotting, the application interfaces with the PicoScope device via the PicoSDK API. This interaction is facilitated through the ctypes library, which allows for calling functions from the PicoScope's shared library.

This project was executed in parallel with the completion of the book "Python for the Lab" by Aquiles Carattino, at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology (IPK) in Berlin, under the supervision of Martin Hepper.

The screenshots below illustrate the graphical user interface (GUI) in operation.

# Model Rocket Project
As part of the "Introduction to Aerospace Engineering" module, our team undertook a project to design, build, and launch a model rocket. This hands-on project provided practical experience with fundamental aerospace engineering principles such as aerodynamics, propulsion, and flight mechanics.

The project commenced with the design phase, where we developed a detailed conceptual design. This involved selecting materials for the rocket body, fins, and nose cone, conducting computational simulations to optimize aerodynamic efficiency, and performing structural integrity analyses to ensure durability during launch and flight. We also created a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to visualize and analyze the effects of different rocket configurations, enabling us to make data-driven decisions during the design process.

In the construction phase, we assembled the rocket body, attached the fins and nose cone, and installed the propulsion system (solid rocket motor: B4-4) and recovery system (parachute). Following construction, we moved to the testing and simulation phase. Here, we conducted static tests to verify motor thrust and stability and used flight simulation software to predict the rocket's trajectory and maximum altitude.

The final phase was the launch. We prepared the launch site with stringent safety protocols, performed pre-launch checks and countdown, and successfully launched the rocket. The flight data was recorded, and the rocket was recovered post-landing. This project not only reinforced our theoretical knowledge but also enhanced our practical skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and project management. The inclusion of the GUI significantly improved our ability to iteratively refine the rocket design and better understand the impact of each configuration change.
